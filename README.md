# Optical-Character-Recognition-application


This project is a **Text Recognition Scanner** application built using Python. The application captures an area of the screen and recognizes text from the captured image. It provides a user-friendly interface to scan text efficiently without using pre-built models like CRNN. Although it is not 100% accurate for handwriting but it works for most of proper formatted hand written text and digital text present on images or websites.

### **Features**
- Capture an area of the screen using a graphical user interface.
- Recognize text from the captured image using optical character recognition (OCR).
- Display recognized text in a clean and readable format.
- Simple, lightweight application without relying on heavy pre-trained models.
